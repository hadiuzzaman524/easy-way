## üîß Flavors & Running the App

This project is configured with the following build flavors:

* `development`
* `staging`
* `production`

### 1. Install Dependencies & Generate Code

Before running the app, make sure to fetch dependencies and generate the necessary code:

```bash
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### 2. Run the App by Flavor

Use the shared entry point (`lib/main.dart`) to run the app with your desired flavor:

```bash
# Development
flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main.dart

# Staging
flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main.dart

# Production
flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main.dart
```

---

## Testing üß™

Run all unit and widget tests with coverage:

```bash
flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

---

## Localization & Translations üåê

Easy Way uses [flutter\_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows Flutter‚Äôs [official internationalization guide][internationalization_link].

### Adding New Strings

1. Add new strings and descriptions in the `lib/l10n/arb/app_bn.arb` and `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb` files:

```json
{
  "@@locale": "bn",
  "appTitle": "‡¶∏‡¶π‡¶ú ‡¶™‡¶•",
  "clear": "‡¶Æ‡ßÅ‡¶õ‡ßÅ‡¶®"
}
```
```json 
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "distance": "Distance",
    "duration": "Duration"
}
```

2. Use localized strings in Dart:

```dart
import 'package:easy_way/l10n/l10n.dart';

final l10n = context.l10n;
Text(l10n.helloWorld);
```

---

## üìÑ Generate and View Documentation

1. **Generate the documentation**
   Run the following command in your project root:

   ```bash
   dart doc .
   ```

2. **Serve and view the documentation**
   Use `dhttpd` to serve the generated docs:

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate dhttpd
   dart pub global run dhttpd --path doc/api
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   After running the above command, open the link provided by `dhttpd` (typically: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)) to view your documentation in the browser.

---

## Additional Notes

* Generate Android upload key:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

* Build a production APK:

```bash
flutter build apk --flavor production -t lib/main.dart
```
